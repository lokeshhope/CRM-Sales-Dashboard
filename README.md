# CRM Sales Dashboard

**Project Overview:**  
This CRM Sales Dashboard was developed to enhance visibility into sales performance for Maven Tech, a company specializing in computer hardware for large businesses. With the implementation of a new CRM system, the goal was to create an interactive dashboard that allows sales managers to monitor quarterly performance metrics effectively.

## Objectives

1. **Prepare the Data for Analysis**
   - Open and analyze the `sales_pipeline.csv` to familiarize yourself with the data, including opportunities won, time periods, products sold, and any missing values.
   - Integrate the `sales_teams.csv` to enrich the sales pipeline dataset with relevant `Manager` and `Regional Office` details for each `Sales Agent`.

2. **Explore the Data with Pivot Tables**
   - Insert pivot tables to:
     - Display opportunities won by quarter.
     - Break down the percentage of won vs. lost opportunities by quarter.
     - Show opportunities won by each sales agent, sorted in descending order.
   - Restructure pivot tables for clarity, ensuring the most recent quarter is displayed first.

3. **Build a Dynamic Dashboard**
   - Create visualizations including:
     - A **Scorecard Chart** to compare opportunities won in Q4 2017 versus Q3 2017.
     - A **Pie Chart** to visualize the percentage of deals won and lost in Q4 2017.
     - A **Bar Chart** to showcase opportunities won by each sales agent for the latest quarter.
   - Incorporate slicers for `Regional Office` and `Manager` fields to enhance interactivity.
   - Arrange visuals to create a cohesive and informative dashboard.

4. **Generate Insights from the Dashboard**
   - Identify key performance insights:
     - **Top Sales Agent:** Darcel Schlecht with the highest sales in 2017.
     - **Lowest Sales Agent:** Wilburn Farren recorded the lowest sales in 2017.
     - Notably, Q3 performed better than Q4, with a win rate of 40% in Q4 2017.

## Data Files
- **sales_pipeline.csv:** Contains details about sales opportunities.
- **sales_teams.csv:** Includes information about sales agents, their managers, and regional offices.

## Technology Stack
- **Tools Used:** Google Sheets for data analysis and visualization.

## Accessing the Dashboard
1. Open the Google Sheets file containing the dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Dashboard" tab for an interactive overview.
3. Utilize the slicers to filter data by `Regional Office` and `Manager`.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate data updates for real-time performance tracking.
- Explore additional data sources for comprehensive analysis.
- Expand the dashboard to include metrics for revenue and profit margins.
